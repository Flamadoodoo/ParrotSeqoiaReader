# ParrotSeqoiaReader
Script for reading Parrot Sequoia EXIF and XMP data from the raw .TIFF images.

This script is coded in Python 2.7 and uses the wonderful exiftool provided by Phil Harvey (https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/).
The script requires that you have exiftool installed on your computer as an .EXE file downloadable from the link above and with an accesible path so it can be
accessed by the script. Further you need a python module in order to communicate with the exiftool .EXE which is
provided by the excellent script from https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool.

This script is free of use and is merely a merger of the tool by Phil Harvey and the python exiftool module for use with the Parrot Sequoia camera.
